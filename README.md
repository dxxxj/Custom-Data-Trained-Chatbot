# Custom-Data-Trained-Chatbot
It is a custom data trained AI chatbot capable of text recognition , image reading and speech recognition along with speech transcription as well .
Basically creating this kind of chatbot with all the above features at once is complex , so the best way to do so is by dividing it into parts .
Firstly we started with creating a basic text recognition chatbot that only responded to text questions , then speech transcribe was added then speech recognition and in the end image reader was added.
We have used LLM model here to create the chatbot.
This model works on deep learning algorithms , i.e a subset of machine learning.
